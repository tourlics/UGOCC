# contribution of DG in occ of multi_task model
(1) change the depth_net into CD CW sCD sCW SSMD SSMD_pred_trained
find out which model has the best performance than tell a good story    step1 ex on 2dbaseline

(2) use the renderocc method, design a model using 2d label and project function improve gp  step3--to a paper

(3) using bevformer as fusion module    step2

# next step

align the labels of waymo occ and nuscenes occ

learning the nerf fusion baseline and set it into my own baseline in fore_past process
